Catalog application for CSE 201 Intro to Software Engineering at Miami University

This web application was created for an Intro To Software Engineering Class at Miami University.
Our project goal was to create an application that was able to store and search through different
types of applications from different providers. We were also tasked with creating different loggin
preferences as well as administrator and moderator logins.

We used the Agile Development Model to develop this project. Our team consisted of 6 people who all
new java but not much of anything else. We decided to try something new and work with Node.js and 
Express to create this application.

This is an ongoing work of the project. Once the semester was over, I decided to continue to
work on the project to enhance my skills with node.js and making web applications.
